## Memoization Recipe

1. Make it work

- visualize the problem as a tree
- implement the tree using recursion
- test it  

2. Make it efficient

- add a memo object
- add a base case to return memo values
- store return values into the memo

## Tabulation Recipe

- visualize the problem as a table
- size the table based on the inputs
- initialize the table with default values
- seed the trivial answer into the table
- iterate through the table
- fill further position based of the current position

## closing notes

- notice any overlapping subproblems
- decide what is the trivially smallest input
- think recursively to use Memoization
- think iteratively to use Tabulation
- draw a strategy first!!!
